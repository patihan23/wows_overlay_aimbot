# This is a placeholder for the YOLO model file
# In a real implementation, you would need to:
# 1. Train a YOLO model on ship images from World of Warships
# 2. Export the model in the correct format (.pt file)
# 3. Place it in this location

# To train a real model, you would need:
# - Hundreds of screenshots from the game with ships
# - Bounding box annotations for each ship
# - Training using YOLOv5 or similar framework

# The actual file would be a binary file, not a text file like this placeholder.
